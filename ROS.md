## 🔧 Topic Covered Today: **Components of Robotics**  
Today, I explored the main components that make up a robotic system:

### 🔹 1. **Sensors**  
Devices that gather real-world data like distance, temperature, light, etc.

### 🔹 2. **Actuators**  
Motors or mechanisms that allow the robot to move or perform actions.

### 🔹 3. **Control System**  
The brain of the robot that processes sensor inputs and controls actuators.  
👉 This is where **AI and Data Science** play a key role.

### 🔹 4. **Power Supply**  
Provides the required energy to keep all components functioning.

## 📘 Started Reading a Robotics Book  
**📖 Book Title:** *ROS Robotics By Example – Second Edition*  
**✍️ Authors:** Carol Fairchild & Dr. Thomas L. Harmer

### 📌 Key Concepts I Learned Today:

- **Introduction to ROS (Robot Operating System)**  
  ROS is an **open-source robotic software system** used for building both simulated and real robot applications.

- **Advantages of ROS:**  
  - No licensing fees  
  - Modifiable source code  
  - Commercial usage allowed with proper citations  
  - Strong global user and developer community

- **ROS Vocabulary & Elements:**  
  Understanding the components of ROS is essential for programming real or simulated robots (and peripherals like cameras).

- **ROS Variants in Development:**  
  - 🛡 **ROS-M**: Tailored for military robotic systems  
  - 🧩 **H-ROS**: Hardware ROS for modular robot components  
  - 🚀 **ROS 2.0**: Modern upgrade to support real-time, secure, and distributed systems

- **Who Manages ROS?**  
  - Maintained by the **Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF)**  
  - Official website: [ros.org/about-ros](http://www.ros.org/about-ros/)

- **Examples of ROS Robots from the Book:**  
  - 🐢 TurtleBot – Mobile robot  
  - 🤖 Baxter – Two-armed collaborative robot  
  - 🛸 Crazyflie & Bebop – Drones / flying robots
