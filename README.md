##  Types of Robots by Autonomy

###  Autonomous Robots:
- Operate fully without human help.
- **Examples**: Self-driving cars, robotic vacuum cleaners.

###  Semi-Autonomous Robots:
- Require partial human control or supervision.
- **Examples**: Surgical robots, drones with manual override capabilities.
